# Context WEEK 8

For this week's project, we had to create 2 APIs along with a new table for our postgreSQL database and fake data for the new table. Our first API was made using graphql on Rails and our second API is a REST API with C#. The goal of this week's project was to allow us to get to know a lot more about APIs and how they work. We used ruby on rails, c# for our programing languages along with heroku to host our APIs online and postman to do GET,PUT,POST requests to test our REST API and publish our work for both APIs.

## The following example shows a REST API request with Postman:

### We start by doing a GET to see the status of the battery 5

### We then do a PUT to change the status of the battery 5 from "Intervention" to "Active"

### As you can see, when we do a GET again, the status of the battery 5 changed and is now "Active"
